# Portfolio en React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I made this personal portfolio to discover React. This portfolio resume my technical skills and my profesional background. As a bonus this portfolio has a hangman game with words contained in the portfolio.
